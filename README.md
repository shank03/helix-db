<hr>

HelixDB was built on the thesis that current database infrastructure is built for how humans think about data, not AI. So we've built a database that makes it easy to build all the components needed for an AI application in a single platform. 

You no longer need a separate application DB, vector DB, graph DB, or application layers to manage the multiple storage locations. All you need to build any application that uses AI, agents or RAG, is a single HelixDB cluster and HelixQL; we take care of the rest.

HelixDB primarily operates with a graph + vector data model, but it can also support support KV, documents, and relational data.


## Key Features
- **Agent Native**: Helix has built-in MCP support to allow your agents to discover data and walk the graph rather than having to generate human readable queries, letting agents actually think.
- **Built-in Embeddings**: Don't worry about needing to embed your data before sending it to Helix, just use the `Embed` function to vectorize text.
- **Tooling for Knowledge Graphs**: It is super easy to ingest your unstructured data into a knowledge graph, with our integrations for Zep-AI's Graphiti, and our own implementation of OpenAI's KG tool.
- **Tooling for RAG**: HelixDB has a built-in vector search, keyword search, and hybrid search that can be used to power your RAG applications.
- **Secure by Default**: HelixDB is private by default. You can only access your data through your compiled HelixQL queries.
- **Your data is yours**: Each Helix cluster is logically isolated in its own VPC meaning only you can ever see your data. 
- **Built to be fast**: Helix is built in Rust and uses LMDB as its storage engine to provide extremely low latencies.

## Getting Started
#### Helix CLI
The Helix CLI tool can be used to check, compile and deploy Helix locally.

1. Install CLI

   ```bash
   curl -sSL "https://install.helix-db.com" | bash
   ```

2. Install Helix

   ```bash
   helix install
   ```

3. Setup

   ```bash
   helix init --path <path-to-project>
   ```

4. Write queries

   Open your newly created `.hx` files and start writing your schema and queries.
   Head over to [our docs](https://docs.helix-db.com/introduction/cookbook/basic) for more information about writing queries
   ```js
   QUERY addUser(name: String, age: I64) =>
      user <- AddN<User({name: name, age: age})
      RETURN user

   QUERY getUser(user_name: String) =>
      user <- N<User::WHERE(_::{name}::EQ(user_name))
      RETURN user
   ```

6. Check your queries compile before building them into API endpoints (optional)

   ```bash
   # in ./<path-to-project>
   helix check
   ```

7. Deploy your queries

   ```bash
   # in ./<path-to-project>
   helix deploy
   ```
8. Start calling them using our [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-ts) or [Python SDK](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-py). For example:
   ```typescript
   import HelixDB from "helix-ts";

   // Create a new HelixDB client
   // The default port is 6969
   const client = new HelixDB();

   // Query the database
   await client.query("addUser", {
      name: "John",
      age: 20
   });

   // Get the created user
   const user = await client.query("getUser", {
      user_name: "John"
   });

   console.log(user);
   ```


Other commands:

- `helix instances` to see all your local instances.
- `helix stop <instance-id>` to stop your local instance with specified id.
- `helix stop --all` to stop all your local instances.

## Roadmap
Our current focus areas include:
- Organizational auth to manage teams, and Helix clusters. 
- Improvements to our server code to massively improve network IO performance and scalability.
- More 3rd party integrations to make it easier to build with Helix.
- Guides and educational content to help you get started with Helix.
- Binary quantisation for even better performance.

Long term projects:
- In-house SOTA knowledge graph ingestion tool for any data source.
- In-house graph-vector storage engine (to replace LMDB)
- In-house network protocol & serdes libraries (similar to protobufs/gRPC)
